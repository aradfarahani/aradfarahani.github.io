## A Hands-On Geophysics Workshop: Seismic Data Acquisition in the Field

Over the past few days, I had the incredible opportunity to **organize and coordinate a geophysics training workshop** focused on **designing seismic surveys and acquiring refraction and surface wave data**. Held in collaboration with **Dr. Ehsan Pegah**, the workshop took place on **December 1st, 2nd, and 3rd (10th, 11th, and 12th of Azar)**, bringing together students eager to gain practical experience in seismic data collection.  

From the very beginning, planning this workshop was both **challenging and exciting**. Organizing the logistics, ensuring the necessary equipment was available, and coordinating with participants required meticulous attention to detail. But seeing it all come together made every effort worthwhile.  

Each day, we moved beyond theoretical knowledge and **stepped into the field**‚Äîsetting up seismic arrays, running field tests, and recording real seismic waves. Dr. Pegah‚Äôs expertise provided invaluable insights, guiding students through the **process of designing seismic operations, data acquisition, and interpretation techniques**.

The most rewarding part? Watching students actively engage, ask insightful questions, and gain confidence in applying geophysical methods in real-world conditions. Moments like these remind me why I‚Äôm passionate about **creating learning experiences that bridge the gap between academia and field practice**.  

Looking forward to organizing more events like this in the future! üöÄüåç
