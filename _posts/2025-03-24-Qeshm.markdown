# **A Spontaneous Adventure to Qeshm: A Nowruz to Remember**

During the excitement of Nowruz, I was at Chakad Cafe with my friend Yazdan, enjoying coffee and casual conversation when a sudden urge to travel hit me. With no plans in mind, I suggested to Yazdan that we take a spontaneous trip. Without hesitation, he agreed, and we started browsing flight tickets, unsure of where to go.  

Then, we stumbled upon *Qeshm*, and something about it just felt right. Within moments, we booked a one-way ticket, embracing the thrill of spontaneity. Qeshm, with its natural beauty and relaxed vibe, promised the perfect escape. That night, I couldn’t sleep from the excitement, envisioning beaches, sunsets, and new adventures. The next day, we were off to the airport—no set plans, just two friends ready for a memorable journey.

# **Qeshm Chronicles: Coffee, Beaches, and Unexpected Delights**

Upon landing in Qeshm, Yazdan and I were filled with excitement and no specific plans, so we headed to the city center. I had heard about *Rise Cafe*, known for the best coffee on the island, and we decided to check it out. The cafe had a relaxed yet sophisticated vibe, and the moment I tasted the coffee, I was blown away—it was hands down the best coffee I’d ever had.

After enjoying our perfect coffee, we made our way to *Aftab Beach*. Despite the unexpectedly chilly weather, the beauty of the beach, the endless horizon, and the soothing sound of the waves made it an unforgettable experience. We took a moment to absorb the peacefulness of the scene, marking the beginning of an amazing trip.

Despite the chill, there was something calming about Aftab Beach. We wandered along the shore, letting the cold waves lap at our feet and enjoying the stillness of the moment. The best part? We didn’t have a schedule, didn’t have anywhere to rush to. It was just us, the beach, and the slow pace of life in Qeshm.

As the sun started to dip lower in the sky, casting a golden glow over everything, I couldn’t help but think back to how this all started. A spontaneous decision, a quick glance at a ticket website, and now here we were—sipping incredible coffee and strolling on a quiet beach, with no plans other than to soak up the moment.

# **A Seafood Feast at C Roll Restaurant: The Freshest Delights of Qeshm**

After the incredible sunset at Aftab Beach, Yazdan and I were both feeling the familiar rumble of hunger. We didn’t have a set plan for dinner, but thanks to Google Maps, we quickly found ourselves heading to *C Roll Restaurant*, a spot famous for its seafood, according to glowing reviews. There was one thing we quickly realized when we looked at the menu: this place was all about seafood—and I mean *all* about seafood.

Now, seafood isn't always my first choice, but given that we were on Qeshm Island, surrounded by fresh catches from the sea, we figured we had to dive in (pun intended). We didn’t take long to decide. After reading through the options, Yazdan and I both agreed to order the *Sea Plate*, a massive seafood platter that came loaded with *Ghalieh Mahi* (a delicious Persian fish stew), shrimp, calamari, crispy French fries, and a side of rice. Honestly, it sounded too good to pass up—and I had a feeling it would be ridiculously fresh.

# **Chasing Sunrises and Coding: A Peaceful Start in Qeshm**

After a delicious seafood meal at *C Roll Restaurant*, Yazdan and I headed back to the beach to catch the sunrise, eager to experience Qeshm’s natural beauty in the early morning light. The air was cool, and the beach was peaceful, with hardly anyone else around.  

While Yazdan soaked in the view, I couldn’t resist pulling out my laptop to get some work done. As the sun rose, casting vibrant colors across the sky, I found a surreal balance between the beauty around me and the code I was working on. It was the perfect combination of productivity and tranquility, setting the tone for the rest of the day.

As the sun slowly rose over the beach, I alternated between working on my laptop and soaking in the stunning colors of the sky. The calming sound of the waves and the quiet presence of Yazdan made the moment feel perfectly aligned. By the time I finished my work, the beach was bathed in golden light.  

We walked along the shoreline, feeling relaxed and rejuvenated by the peaceful surroundings and the warmth of the sun. It was the ideal start to the day—productive, serene, and set in the natural beauty of Qeshm.

# **Exploring Stars Valley (Stala Kafta) in Qeshm: A Geology Lover’s Dream**

After a peaceful morning, Yazdan and I set off for Stars Valley (Stala Kafta), a geological wonder I had been eager to explore. As a geology student, seeing its dramatic rock formations—shaped by erosion over millennia—was like stepping into a living textbook.

The valley’s towering spires, narrow canyons, and fortress-like formations felt almost otherworldly. I excitedly explained the geological processes behind them, while Yazdan, though less invested in geology, admired the breathtaking views. The valley’s silence and mystical energy made the experience even more special.

From a high viewpoint, we took in the vast, sculpted landscape, reflecting on nature’s power and beauty. Stars Valley was a true highlight of our trip—a perfect fusion of science, wonder, and adventure.

# **Exploring the Qeshm Hara Forest: A Unique Ecosystem in the Heart of Qeshm Island**

After our awe-inspiring visit to *Stars Valley*, Yazdan and I were eager for our next stop: the *Qeshm Hara Forest*. This hidden gem, located in northern Qeshm, is a striking contrast to the island’s arid landscapes, featuring vast mangrove forests that thrive in the tidal flats of the Persian Gulf.  

As we approached, the air grew cooler, and the scenery turned lush and green. Covering around 20,000 hectares, the Hara Forest is often called the "green lung" of Qeshm, playing a crucial role in supporting biodiversity, preventing coastal erosion, and providing a sanctuary for migratory birds. It was the perfect next chapter in our exploration of the island’s natural wonders.

Entering the *Hara Forest* felt like stepping into another world, where towering mangroves formed a dense, intricate network of roots rising from the brackish waters of the Gulf. These trees not only adapt to shifting tides but also play a crucial role in stabilizing the coastline and supporting diverse marine life.  

The serene atmosphere, with birdsong and gentle tides, made for a peaceful escape. We spotted herons and egrets resting among the trees, a reminder of the forest’s importance as a migratory stopover. A boat ride through the winding waterways gave us a closer look at the thriving ecosystem, from fish darting among the roots to crabs scuttling along the muddy shores. It was an unforgettable glimpse into one of Qeshm’s most unique natural wonders.

Exploring the *Qeshm Hara Forest* revealed its importance as both a stunning landscape and a vital ecosystem. The mangroves protect coastal communities and provide a habitat for diverse marine life, highlighting the need for conservation.  

As we left, we felt grateful for the experience and the reminder of nature’s delicate balance. Visiting the *Hara Forest* was the perfect way to conclude our day, showcasing Qeshm’s incredible diversity—from the dramatic formations of *Stars Valley* to the lush beauty of the mangroves.

# **A Local Culinary Adventure at Soheyly Restaurant: Qeshm’s Seafood Delights**

After exploring the Qeshm *Hara Forest*, we were eager for an authentic local meal. Taking the advice of friendly locals, we headed to *Soheyly Restaurant*, known for its fresh seafood and regional specialties.  

The restaurant had a cozy, welcoming atmosphere with both indoor and outdoor seating. We chose a spot under a canopy, enjoying the lively street view. Excited to experience the island’s flavors, we ordered a variety of seafood dishes, eager to indulge in the best of Qeshm’s cuisine.

# **A Perfect Ending to an Unforgettable Trip: Coding by the Beach and Heading Home**

After a delicious meal at *Soheyly Restaurant*, Yazdan and I decided to make the most of our final hours in Qeshm with one last visit to the beach. As the sun cast a golden glow over the waves, we soaked in the peaceful atmosphere. While Yazdan relaxed, I took the opportunity to finish some coding, finding inspiration in the serene surroundings.  

As the sun set, we packed up and made our way to the airport, reflecting on our unforgettable trip. From the breathtaking landscapes of *Stars Valley* and *Hara Forest* to the incredible local cuisine, Qeshm had been an adventure full of beauty, spontaneity, and inspiration.

A spontaneous decision turned a simple conversation into an unforgettable NooRuz trip to Qeshm. This journey wasn’t just about the destination but about embracing the unknown and living in the moment. It’s a reminder that the best adventures often come unplanned. So, if you’ve been waiting for a sign to travel—this is it! Sometimes, the best decisions are made on a whim.
