**A Spontaneous Adventure to Qeshm: A Nowruz to Remember**

The excitement of Nowruz—our Iranian New Year—was already in the air, and I had the privilege of spending part of the holiday with my good friend, Mohammadhossein Yazdanifar (or just Yazdan, as we call him). We were at Chakad Cafe in the ASP Towers, enjoying some good Coffee, casual conversation, and the overall chill vibes that come with the start of a new year. There was nothing planned, nothing urgent—we were simply soaking in the joy of the moment.

As we talked about life, old memories, and dreams for the future, something hit me. I was suddenly overcome with the urge to *travel*. Maybe it was the excitement of the holiday or the realization that I hadn't taken a real trip in a while, but I blurted out to Yazdan, “You know what? I really want to take a trip somewhere. Like, right now.”

Yazdan, being the spontaneous guy he is, didn’t miss a beat. “Okay, let’s go!” he said, as if traveling somewhere random was the most natural thing in the world.

It was the perfect blend of excitement and possibility. But there was just one catch—neither of us had any idea where we were going.

So, we did what anyone in this situation would do—we pulled out our phones and started browsing flight ticket websites. There was no real plan, no destination in mind. Just pure wanderlust and the desire to *go*. For a while, we scrolled through endless options, debating, joking, and fantasizing about the places we could visit. But nothing felt quite right. Until…

Then, out of nowhere, something caught my eye. The name glimmered on the screen. *Qeshm*.

For a moment, I just stared at it. There was something about the name, something about the idea of Qeshm, that seemed to fit perfectly with the vibe of the day—spontaneous, fresh, and exciting. Without much thought, I glanced at Yazdan, and I could see that he was already intrigued too. The next thing I knew, we had booked a one-way ticket to Qeshm.

Now, Qeshm is an island in the southern part of Iran, famous for its natural beauty, unique landscapes, and the kind of relaxed vibe that makes you feel like you're in a world of your own. It was the perfect escape—a place where time slows down, and you can truly disconnect and just enjoy the moment.

The moment we confirmed our tickets, I felt an adrenaline rush that’s hard to describe. I was so hyped up about the idea that I couldn’t even sleep that night. It wasn’t about the destination anymore—it was about the *experience* of doing something completely spontaneous, of saying "yes" to an adventure without any hesitation or overthinking.

I spent the rest of the night laying awake, picturing the beaches, the sunsets, the adventure waiting for us. My mind raced with thoughts of what we’d do, where we’d go, and how we would make the most of this unexpected trip. Yazdan, on the other hand, was in his own world, probably already planning the best spots to visit, the best foods to try, and the best stories we would have to tell afterward.

The next day, we packed up and were off to the airport. With no set agenda, no hotel reservations—just our tickets and a sense of excitement—Qeshm was calling us, and we were ready to answer.

**Qeshm Chronicles: Coffee, Beaches, and Unexpected Delights**

![photo_2025-03-25_11-41-33 (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3381544d-3c48-4c21-800e-9fb669c0aedf)

When we finally landed in Qeshm, the excitement was palpable. The island breeze greeted us, and it felt like a fresh start to something new. With no real plan other than to see where the day took us, Yazdan and I jumped into a cab headed straight for the city center. But there was one thing I had heard about that I couldn’t shake off—a place called *Rise Cafe*. Word on the street was that it had the best coffee in Qeshm. And, well, when you’re in the mood for good coffee, you just follow that lead.

As we rolled up to Rise Cafe, I had no idea what to expect. It’s funny how a simple cafe can feel like the perfect introduction to a new place. The vibe was laid-back but with a touch of sophistication, and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee immediately hit us as we walked in. We ordered our coffees, and as soon as the cups arrived, I took my first sip... and wow. That moment. I’ll be honest—I didn’t expect much from a cafe on a small island, but this was, without a doubt, the *best* coffee I had ever tasted. The rich, bold flavor was perfectly balanced, smooth, and just… perfect. I couldn’t help but tell Yazdan, "This is *it*. Best coffee of my life!" And he agreed. It was a small thing, but it set the tone for the whole trip.

![photo_2025-03-25_11-26-50](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/480c5960-7eb3-41b2-bef3-f4d4ffcfd47b)

After savoring our coffee and soaking in the relaxed atmosphere of Rise Cafe, we decided to head to *Aftab Beach*, one of the popular spots on the island. We’d heard it was beautiful, but nothing really prepared us for what we found when we got there.

The moment we arrived at the beach, we realized that the weather was a bit cooler than we expected—it was definitely on the chilly side. But the sight of the beach, the endless horizon, and the soft sound of the waves crashing was still enough to make it worth it. We took a few moments to just stand there, breathing in the fresh sea air and appreciating the serenity of it all.

![photo_2025-03-25_11-41-30](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c95182da-34db-44d0-b90c-7245ece7ae78)

Despite the chill, there was something calming about Aftab Beach. We wandered along the shore, letting the cold waves lap at our feet and enjoying the stillness of the moment. The best part? We didn’t have a schedule, didn’t have anywhere to rush to. It was just us, the beach, and the slow pace of life in Qeshm. 

![photo_2025-03-23_19-07-03](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6603a9ee-fcf0-4124-9b34-6f6e593a9d4f)

As the sun started to dip lower in the sky, casting a golden glow over everything, I couldn’t help but think back to how this all started. A spontaneous decision, a quick glance at a ticket website, and now here we were—sipping incredible coffee and strolling on a quiet beach, with no plans other than to soak up the moment.

**A Seafood Feast at C Roll Restaurant: The Freshest Delights of Qeshm**

After the incredible sunset at Aftab Beach, Yazdan and I were both feeling the familiar rumble of hunger. We didn’t have a set plan for dinner, but thanks to Google Maps, we quickly found ourselves heading to *C Roll Restaurant*, a spot famous for its seafood, according to glowing reviews. There was one thing we quickly realized when we looked at the menu: this place was all about seafood—and I mean *all* about seafood.

Now, seafood isn't always my first choice, but given that we were on Qeshm Island, surrounded by fresh catches from the sea, we figured we had to dive in (pun intended). We didn’t take long to decide. After reading through the options, Yazdan and I both agreed to order the *Sea Plate*, a massive seafood platter that came loaded with *Ghalieh Mahi* (a delicious Persian fish stew), shrimp, calamari, crispy French fries, and a side of rice. Honestly, it sounded too good to pass up—and I had a feeling it would be ridiculously fresh.

**Chasing Sunrises and Coding: A Peaceful Start in Qeshm**

After our delicious seafood feast at *C Roll Restaurant*, we were both pretty full, but there was still something on our minds. One of the things that had drawn us to Qeshm in the first place was the island’s natural beauty—and we weren’t about to miss a chance to experience that in the early hours of the morning. We’d seen the beach at sunset, but we had heard the sunrises were just as stunning.

So, with a little excitement and a sense of adventure still lingering, we decided to head back to the beach. We figured, why not catch the sunrise and enjoy the peaceful stillness of the island before the day got busy?

As we arrived at the beach, it was still early, and the world felt like it was in a quiet, calm pause. The air was cool, the sand still damp from the night’s breeze, and the ocean was a soft, shimmering gray in the pre-dawn light. There was hardly anyone else around, and it felt like we had the whole beach to ourselves.

But here’s where things took a little turn—while Yazdan was soaking in the view, I found myself still thinking about the work I’d left behind. I had brought my laptop with me on this trip (because, of course, I’m *always* coding), and I figured this quiet moment on the beach would be the perfect chance to get some work done.

![photo_2025-03-25_11-41-28](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42165666-5a03-4daa-a461-3d32f660e321)


So, while the sun began to peek over the horizon, casting the sky in hues of pink and orange, I found myself deep in code. There’s something almost surreal about coding with such a peaceful, beautiful backdrop. The contrast between the natural beauty unfolding around me and the world I was creating on the screen felt like the perfect balance. My mind was clear, the air was fresh, and I could feel the early morning energy of Qeshm weaving its way into both my work and my thoughts.

![photo_2025-03-25_11-41-27](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28945085-9677-4c5a-8575-83032c1c99a5)


I kept glancing up from my laptop to see the sky slowly lighting up—first a soft glow, then a full-on explosion of colors. It was incredible. The sound of the waves was calming, almost meditative, and each line of code felt like a small victory as the sun rose higher. Yazdan occasionally checked in with me, sharing a quiet smile as he watched the sky shift. We didn’t say much, but we didn’t need to. It was one of those moments where everything was just… right.

![photo_2025-03-25_11-41-07](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48d879ca-7b64-4bb4-976d-69f3598dc338)

By the time I finished a little bit of work, the sun had fully risen, and the beach was bathed in golden light. It was the perfect start to the day—peaceful, productive, and surrounded by the natural beauty of Qeshm. I closed my laptop and finally joined Yazdan to walk along the shoreline, feeling both relaxed and invigorated. The sun was warm, the sky was clear, and we were in a place that felt like it had all the time in the world.

**Exploring Stars Valley (Stala Kafta) in Qeshm: A Geology Lover’s Dream**

After that peaceful sunrise on the beach and a productive morning of coding, Yazdan and I decided to head out for another adventure—this time to a place I had been especially excited to visit: *Stala Kafta* (also known as *Stars Valley*). As a senior undergraduate geology student, I’ve always been fascinated by unique land formations, and the mysterious rock structures of Stars Valley had been on my radar since we first planned our trip to Qeshm.

Stars Valley is one of the most remarkable geological sites on the island, famous for its otherworldly rock formations that look like they’ve come straight out of a fantasy novel. The valley is shaped by thousands of years of erosion, creating towering spires, narrow canyons, and strange rock shapes that seem almost sculpted by hand. It's not just a natural wonder; it's a geological playground, and for someone like me, it was an absolute must-see.

We hopped in a car and made our way to the valley, which was about a 30-minute drive from the city center. Along the way, I couldn’t help but marvel at the island's landscapes—rugged, arid, and dotted with occasional patches of greenery. But nothing could prepare me for the spectacle we were about to witness.

As we approached *Stars Valley*, the first thing that struck me was how surreal it looked. The rocks were shaped in these towering spires and jagged formations, casting long, strange shadows as the morning sun began to climb higher in the sky. It was like stepping into a different world, one that had been slowly carved out over millennia by natural forces. You could see layers of sediment, the effects of wind, water, and time all on display in the rock faces.

For me, it was like stepping into a textbook—everything I’d studied in geology suddenly came to life right in front of me. I felt a kind of excitement that only a geologist could understand. There was something mesmerizing about seeing the forces of nature at work, witnessing firsthand the slow but powerful process of erosion that had shaped this incredible landscape.

We wandered through the narrow canyons, navigating our way around the massive stone formations. I found myself stopping every few steps to examine the rock layers, the textures, and the various minerals that made up the landscape. Yazdan, who wasn’t as invested in geology as I was, was still enjoying the stunning views, taking in the beauty of the valley, snapping photos, and marveling at how this place seemed to glow in the sunlight.

![photo_2025-03-25_11-41-23](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c01e4b4e-0659-4e8e-9b41-e1798a2558d2)

At one point, we came across a formation that looked almost like an ancient castle, with sharp spires reaching up toward the sky. I couldn’t help but explain to Yazdan the process behind it—how wind and rain over thousands of years had eroded the softer layers of rock, leaving behind these dramatic, almost fortress-like structures. I could tell he was getting a little more interested in the geology, even though he was more focused on the views.

But it wasn’t just the geology that made *Stars Valley* so special—it was the overall atmosphere. There’s a kind of silence in the valley, a peaceful quiet that allows you to just be present in the moment. The landscape has an almost mystical energy to it. I could’ve spent hours there just exploring, taking notes, and soaking it all in. For me, it was the kind of experience that reminded me why I fell in love with geology in the first place—the feeling of wonder that comes with understanding how these natural wonders were formed.

After a while, we reached a viewpoint where we could look out over the entire valley, seeing the twisted, sculpted landscape spread out beneath us. It was breathtaking. I sat there for a while, just taking it all in, appreciating the beauty of nature and the slow passage of time that had created this incredible place.

![photo_2025-03-25_11-27-13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c1ddbc1-ba44-4a5e-b1b2-c04719e7b314)

As we made our way back to the car, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of gratitude. Not only had I gotten to experience something truly incredible, but I had done so in the company of a good friend who was open to sharing these moments with me, even if he wasn’t a geology nerd like me.

*Stars Valley* (or *Stala Kafta*) turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. It wasn’t just the perfect mix of science and nature—it was a reminder of how powerful and beautiful the natural world is, and how lucky we are to witness it. I highly recommend visiting if you’re ever in Qeshm, whether you’re a geology enthusiast or just someone who loves amazing landscapes.

**Exploring the Qeshm Hara Forest: A Unique Ecosystem in the Heart of Qeshm Island**

After our mind-blowing visit to *Stars Valley* (or *Stala Kafta*), Yazdan and I were on a natural high. The geological wonders of the island had truly captured our attention, but we weren’t about to stop there. We still had one more amazing stop on our itinerary for the day: the *Qeshm Hara Forest*.

The Hara Forest is one of the island’s most unique and lesser-known natural treasures, and it’s a place that blends both environmental and cultural importance. Situated in the northern part of Qeshm Island, this coastal forest is made up of *mangrove trees*, which thrive in the tidal flats and saltwater conditions of the Persian Gulf. It’s one of the most fascinating ecosystems you’ll find in the region, and it was a complete contrast to the arid desert landscape of *Stars Valley*.

We took a short drive to the forest, and as we got closer, the change in scenery was immediate. The air felt cooler, and the landscape turned greener. The Hara Forest covers an area of around 20,000 hectares, and it’s considered one of the largest mangrove forests in the Persian Gulf. It’s often called the "green lung" of Qeshm Island because of the vital role it plays in supporting local biodiversity, preventing coastal erosion, and even providing a sanctuary for migratory birds.

![photo_2025-03-24_15-35-57](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75c17f25-5cad-4027-9a5a-cbb8ce5ed95e)

As we entered the forest, it felt like we were stepping into a completely different world. The thick mangrove trees stood tall, their roots extending deep into the brackish water of the Gulf. The trees are perfectly adapted to the salty, ever-changing tides, and their intricate root systems, which emerge above the water, form a dense and labyrinthine network. These roots aren’t just beautiful; they also help stabilize the soil and prevent coastal erosion, which is crucial for maintaining the delicate coastal environment.

Walking through the Hara Forest was a peaceful and serene experience. The air was filled with the earthy scent of saltwater, and there was a kind of quiet that hung over the forest. Birds chirped in the distance, and the gentle lapping of the tide on the shore added to the calm atmosphere. It was like we were in a hidden oasis, away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The shade from the mangroves offered a cool respite from the afternoon sun, and the whole place just felt... still. It was like time slowed down, and all we could do was take in the beauty of the ecosystem around us.

As a nature lover, I couldn’t help but admire the unique ecological role the mangrove forest plays in the region. The trees provide shelter and food for a variety of wildlife, from crabs and fish to birds and other small animals. We even spotted a few species of herons, egrets, and other waterfowl who were using the mangroves as a resting spot during their migration. The Hara Forest is an important stopover for many migratory birds, and seeing them in their natural habitat was an extra treat.

We also learned from our guide that the mangroves in Qeshm are home to some unique plant and animal species that are specially adapted to the harsh, saline conditions of the coastal ecosystem. The roots of the mangrove trees, which grow above the water, are covered in small barnacles and other marine organisms, creating a thriving micro-ecosystem in and of themselves. It’s incredible how life has adapted to such an unusual environment, where the tides shift and the water is both salt and brackish.

We took a boat ride through the winding waterways, gliding through the labyrinth of mangrove trees. It was an unforgettable way to experience the forest from a different perspective. The boat ride allowed us to get up close to the intricate root systems and witness the richness of the ecosystem up close. We even saw small fish darting in and out of the mangrove roots, as well as the occasional crab scuttling across the mud.

![photo_2025-03-25_11-26-30](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad23dbbf-73a8-4ec3-8672-d311f1922b6a)

As we explored deeper into the Hara Forest, it became clear that this was more than just a beautiful place—it was a vital and fragile ecosystem that required protection and conservation. The mangrove trees play an essential role in protecting coastal communities from storm surges and flooding, while also providing a habitat for a variety of marine life.

After spending some time in the forest, we slowly made our way out, feeling a sense of gratitude for having witnessed such a unique part of Qeshm. The Hara Forest wasn’t just a destination—it was an experience that reminded us of the delicate balance of nature and the importance of preserving environments like this one.

Visiting the *Qeshm Hara Forest* was the perfect way to round off our day of exploration. From the geological wonders of *Stars Valley* to the lush, green beauty of the mangrove forest, Qeshm truly showed us the diverse and stunning ecosystems it has to offer.

**A Local Culinary Adventure at Soheyly Restaurant: Qeshm’s Seafood Delights**

After exploring the Qeshm *Hara Forest*, we were both in the mood for a hearty and authentic lunch to cap off the day’s adventures. One of the best parts of traveling, in my opinion, is the chance to experience local flavors, and we were eager to dive into the regional cuisine. So, we decided to ask a few locals for recommendations on where to get the best traditional food. They didn’t hesitate to suggest *Soheyly Restaurant*—a popular spot known for its fresh seafood and local specialties. Naturally, we took their advice and headed straight there.

When we arrived at *Soheyly Restaurant*, it immediately felt like the perfect place to enjoy a laid-back, authentic meal. The atmosphere was cozy, with a welcoming vibe that made it easy to relax and soak in the surroundings. The restaurant had a mix of indoor and outdoor seating, and we chose a table under a canopy, giving us a perfect view of the vibrant, bustling street outside.

Once seated, we were eager to see what the local seafood had to offer. The menu at *Soheyly* was packed with all sorts of regional dishes, many of them featuring the freshest catches from the Persian Gulf. We decided to go all-in and ordered a variety of dishes that we’d heard about from the locals, hoping to get a true taste of the island.

![photo_2025-03-25_11-41-21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1afd351-982d-461e-b252-c53cbe447e18)

**A Perfect Ending to an Unforgettable Trip: Coding by the Beach and Heading Home**

![photo_2025-03-25_11-41-18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba0c2c57-65b9-4715-82a1-afbb48392d77)

After an amazing lunch at *Soheyly Restaurant*, Yazdan and I decided to make the most of our last few hours in Qeshm. We weren’t ready to leave just yet, so we decided to visit the beach one final time. The sun was beginning to dip lower in the sky, casting everything in a golden glow. There was something so calming about the beach—the soft sound of the waves, the cool breeze, and the stillness of the moment. It felt like the perfect way to wind down after a busy day of exploration.

As we sat down on the sand, I realized I wasn’t quite finished with the project I had been working on during our trip. As much as I had enjoyed soaking in the sights of Qeshm, I still had a bit of coding to do. So, I pulled out my laptop, set it on my lap, and began typing away while Yazdan relaxed beside me, watching the waves crash gently against the shore.

It was one of those moments where everything felt perfectly aligned—the work I was doing, the beauty of the surroundings, and the peaceful atmosphere of the beach. The view was incredible. The horizon stretched endlessly, painted with warm hues of orange and pink as the sun started to set. The combination of the natural beauty and my focus on coding created a strangely perfect balance. There’s something uniquely inspiring about working in a place like this—something about the open space and the sense of tranquility made my mind clearer, and the ideas flowed more easily.

As the sky grew darker and the last rays of sunlight faded, we packed up our things and headed toward the airport. The trip had been exactly what we needed—adventurous, spontaneous, and full of surprises. From the stunning geological formations of *Stars Valley* to the serene beauty of the *Hara Forest*, and of course, the mouthwatering local cuisine, Qeshm had given us more than we could have hoped for.

![photo_2025-03-25_11-24-59](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df89d107-94da-4ad0-be65-d7c97a11d190)

This trip ended up being one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life. Sometimes, the best adventures happen when you least expect them. A simple conversation, a spontaneous decision, and a quick glance at a flight website—this is how a NooRuz holiday turned into an unexpected, unforgettable journey. The trip to Qeshm wasn’t just about the island; it was about living in the moment, embracing the unknown, and reminding ourselves that life is too short to over-plan everything.

So, here’s to more adventures, more spontaneity, and to the beauty of unexpected trips. If you’ve been waiting for a sign to book your next journey, let this be it—sometimes the best decisions are the ones you make on a whim.

I’ll leave you with this: next time you’re sitting in a cafe with friends, chatting and laughing, just remember—you never know when a conversation might turn into your next great adventure.
