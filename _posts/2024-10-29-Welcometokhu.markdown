This year, as a small member of the Kharazmi University Geology Student Scientific Association, my fellow members and I decided to assist the Faculty of Earth Sciences in organizing the welcome ceremony for the incoming 1403 students across all three levels—undergraduate, master's, and PhD.  

What made this especially challenging for me was that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I had never had the chance to attend such events myself. I had no real idea of what to expect. So, the first thing we did as a team was make a promise to handle everything from start to finish on our own.  

Over the past two weeks, we worked hard to coordinate every detail—designing posters, creating motion graphics, recording a video to introduce the faculty, organizing live music performances, and anything else you can imagine. In parallel with all this, preparing the welcome packs turned out to be a fun and exciting process (so much so that I think I was more excited than the new students themselves!).  

Despite all the challenges, the best part of today was when the event ended, and we received overwhelmingly positive feedback from both students and professors. At that moment, all the exhaustion from the past two weeks simply vanished. :)  

And honestly, I’m just posting this because I saw others sharing pictures of their welcome packs—so here’s mine! ;)
