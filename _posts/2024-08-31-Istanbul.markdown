After witnessing the inspiring moment when a Turkish athlete won a silver medal at the Olympics (Paris-2024), I felt a strong urge to explore Turkey, particularly Istanbul, the city where continents meet and cultures blend seamlessly. However, I needed a compelling reason to embark on this journey.
That‚Äôs when I discovered that my favorite artist, King Raam, was performing a concert in Istanbul. This was the perfect catalyst for my adventure! Without hesitation, I booked my hotel and flight, eager to experience the magic of Istanbul and the electrifying performance of King Raam.

Upon arriving in Istanbul, my first stop was Nero Cafe for a much-needed Americano to shake off the fatigue from my flight.

On the second day of my trip, I decided to visit my childhood friend Amir. Seeing Amir, now a successful dentist, was incredibly heartwarming. It's always wonderful to witness a friend achieving their dreams.

After our reunion, I indulged in some local snacks, including the famous baklava and Turkish coffee. Based on my research, I knew that one of the most iconic places to experience these treats was Hafiz Mustafa, established in 1864. The experience did not disappoint! I ordered Humbara and Turk Kahvesi, both of which were exceptional.

Later in the evening, I headed to Gaam Burger for dinner, where I had the incredible opportunity to meet King Raam in person. It was an honor to take a picture with him, making the day even more memorable. After this exciting encounter, I returned to my hotel, reflecting on the amazing experiences of the day.
